# Deep learning for reducing the quantity of contrast agents in microCT

The architechture was inspired by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/)

## Overview

---
### Goal

The goal of this project is devided in 2 parts: contrast enhancement and organ segmentation on micro-CT images. For both methods a U-NET is implemented.

### Data

The dataset from the study of [S. Rosenhein et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018294) was used. This contained 6 mice that could be used for contrast enhancement and 16 that could be used for organ segmentation. This data was preprocessed before implementing.
